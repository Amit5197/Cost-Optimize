Cost Optimization Solution for Azure Cosmos DB Billing Records
Overview
To significantly reduce costs for your Azure Cosmos DB, while ensuring data availability and seamless user experience, implement a tiered storage strategy. The core idea: move billing records older than three months from Cosmos DB to Azure Blob Storage, keeping recent records in Cosmos DB for low-latency access. The existing API layer handles reads/writes without changes to the client.

Proposed Architecture
Key Components
Azure Cosmos DB: Stores only recent (<=3 months) billing records.

Azure Blob Storage: Holds archived records (>3 months) in compressed JSON or Avro format.

Azure Functions/Logic Apps: Automate archival and retrieval logic.

API Layer: Abstracts data store details; routes requests to correct backend.

Data Access Flow
Write: New records created in Cosmos DB only.

Read:

If record age â‰¤3 months: Fetch from Cosmos DB.

If record age >3 months: If not in Cosmos DB, redirect lookup to Blob Storage; serve from there.

Archive Job: Scheduled Azure Function or Logic App moves records older than 3 months from Cosmos DB to Blob Storage, then deletes them from Cosmos DB after successful copy.

Cost Optimization Approach
Storage Savings: Azure Blob Storage is significantly cheaper than Cosmos DB for cold/archival data.

Compute Savings: Cosmos DB RU charges drop as working set size reduces.

No Data Loss & No Downtime: Atomic archive, verify, then delete logic ensures zero-loss and uninterrupted DB service.

Ease of Implementation: Uses built-in Azure serverless tools, maintainable with minimal ops.

Implementation: Core Logic
1. Archival Function (Pseudocode)
python
def archive_old_records():
    cutoff_date = today_minus_3_months()
    # Query Cosmos DB for records older than cutoff
    old_records = cosmos_query(f"SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.timestamp < '{cutoff_date}'")
    for record in old_records:
        # Write to Blob Storage in compressed format
        blob_client.upload_blob(record.id + ".json.gz", gzip_compress(json.dumps(record)))
        # Delete from Cosmos DB
        cosmos_delete(record.id)
Schedule this function to run daily or hourly using Azure Functions and Timer Triggers.

2. API Layer Read Logic (Pseudocode)
python
def get_billing_record(record_id):
    record = cosmos_get(record_id)
    if record:
        return record
    else:
        # Attempt to fetch from Blob Storage if not in Cosmos
        blob = blob_get(record_id + ".json.gz")
        if blob:
            return json.loads(gzip_decompress(blob))
        else:
            return None  # Record not found
3. Zero-Downtime Migration Script
Implement migration in small batches.

For each batch:

Copy records to Blob.

Verify copy (e.g. using checksums).

Delete from Cosmos DB.

Monitor and log failures for retry.

Example command for batch execution (using Azure CLI or Data Factory):

bash
# Pseudocode for batch archival (for actual use, integrate with SDK)
az cosmosdb document list --filter "timestamp < cutoff_date" | \
foreach record.id (
    az storage blob upload --file record.json.gz --container billing-archive
    az cosmosdb document delete --id record.id
)
Maintenance & Monitoring
Set up alerts if archival or retrieval fails.

Log every archival operation for audit.

Validate data integrity (random checksum audits).

Adjust archival policy if access patterns change.

Key Benefits
Storage cost reduced by orders of magnitude for old records.

Performance for recent queries unaffected.

Compliance: All data preserved, still accessible.

No user-impact: Existing APIs, SLAs, and contracts intact.

By following this approach, you achieve a scalable, cost-efficient, and low-complexity archival solution in serverless Azure with no technical disruption or data loss.
